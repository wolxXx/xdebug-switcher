# xdebug-switcher
simple js class for enabling or disabling xdebug cookie<br />
<br />
find package at:<br /> 
 - composer / packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/wolxxx/xdebug-switcher composer require wolxxx/xdebug-switcher<br />
 - npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xdebug-switcher npm i xdebug-switcher<br />
   <br />
as the chrome extension is dead and it is not very convenient to install extensions, add this xdebug.js snippet to your website and enable or disable xdebug sessions right in the page.<br />
   <br />
you may add css styles for .xdebug-helper<br />
   <br />
currently only works for phpstorm, as it is needed right now. <br />
other variations are planned.
